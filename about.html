    <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is running. I first got into running because I participated in different sports like field hockey, basketball, and track and field, which all rely on having good stamina. Normally, I run an average of 3 miles a day throughout the week and then longer runs on Saturday. I am trying to train for a half marathon that is occurring in the summer. Right now, during the winter, it is harder to train and go for runs due to the weather, so I have to run on a treadmill indoors. </p>
